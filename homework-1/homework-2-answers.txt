1. The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element, while the class attribute specifies a class for it. They can both be used to point to a name in a style sheet. They are different because multiple elements can share a class, while an id element is unique to one HTML element.
2. There are two parts of a CSS rule, which are a selector and a declaration.
3. The important keyword takes precedence over everything. If two or more CSS rules point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity will take precedence and be applied. For inheritance, a child element naturally inherits the properties of its parent element. If multiple CSS rules with the same specificity point to the same element, the rule applied last will take precedence and be applied. 
4. Block displays an element as a block element, starts on a new line, and takes up the entire width. Inline is the default, displays an element as an inline element, and is unaffected by height and width properties. Inline-block displays an element as an inline-level block container and the element is formatted the same as inline, but height and width properties can be applied.
5. A border is around every box, and it separates the edge of one box from another. Margins let you make gaps between boxes. Padding lets you control the amount of space between the content in an element and its border.

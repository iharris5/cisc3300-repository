1. Flexbox and CSS grid both let you have a parent container that you can put elements inside, and you can position and align them in different ways.The main difference is that flexbox is 1d and CSS grid is 2d, meaning flexbox can control only rows or only columns while CSS grid can make layouts that control both at the same time.
2. Responsive design allows you to make dynamic changes to the appearance of a website based on the screen size and device's orientation. It can be implemented with things like media queries and bootstrap's grid system.

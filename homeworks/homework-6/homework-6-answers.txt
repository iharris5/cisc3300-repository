1. Hoisting is when variables and functions in each exectution context are created prior to execution. Closures are a function's ability to remember the variables and functions declared in its outer scope.
2. PHP, which stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, is an interpreted programming language that is used to build webpages. Server side scripting languages process user input and interact with other servers.
3. PHP and JavaScript have quite a few similarities and differences.For example, they both support if, else if, and else constructs, as well as for, while, and do...while loops. One difference is that for JavaScript variable declaration you use var, let, or const, while for PHP you declare them using a $ sign. Another is that JavaScript uses for...in and for...of loops, while PHP has a foreach loop.
4. PHP can be a good pick over another server side scripting language because it is easier to learn, it is used by most websites, and it is very useful for HTML since it is closely related to it. 
5. Echo and var_dump both output some information, but echo outputs one or more expressions while var_dump dumps information about one or more variables. Var_dump is more detailed because it also shows the type and value of the variables.

1. Relationships in SQL are established associations between two or more tables, based on common fields from multiple tables. Joins are the way we combine two or more tables based on a related column between the tables.
2. Relationships are usually dependent on joins because they are implemented through joins.
3. A PDO is a built in class that comes packaged with PHP to make it easy to interact with databases, and it represents and manages the connection to the database. A DSN, or Data Source Name, is a string that contains information about our connection to the database.
4. Prepared stataments are parameterized and reusable SQL queries which force the developer to write the SQL command and the user-provided data separately.
5. An .env file stores sensitive information and allows you to manage environment variables. You could store things like your database name and database password on it.
